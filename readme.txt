== Description ==
Cubes is a clean, blog-focused, and clear theme. Cubes is a simple, straightforward typography is readable on a wide variety of screen sizes, and suitable for multiple languages. I have designed it using bootstrap, meaning your content takes center-stage, regardless of whether your visitors arrive by smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.

It is distributed under the GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool.
